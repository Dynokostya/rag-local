so this is where I realized that there was really a need to communicate because the data of what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware so we did the software which displays it like this every bubble here is a country this country over here is um this is China and this is India the size of the bubble is the population and on this axis here I put fertility rate because my students what they said when they looked upon the world and I asked them what do you really think about the world well I first discovered that their textbook was Tintin mainly and they said the world is still we and them and we is Western World and them is third world and what do you mean with Western world I said well that's long life in small family and third world is short life in large family so so this is what I could display here I put fertility rate here number of children per woman 1 2 3 4 up to about eight children per woman we have very good data since 1962 1960 about on the size of families in all countries the error margin is narrow here I put life expectancy at Birth from 30 years in some countries up to about 70 years and 1962 there was really a group of countries here that was industrialized countries and they had small families and long life lives and these were the developing countries they had large families and they had relatively short lives now what has happened since 1962 we want to see the change are the students right it's still two types of countries or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here or have they got longer lives and live up there let's see we start the world and this is all un statistic that has been available here we go can you see there it's China they're moving against Better Health they're improving there all the green Latin American countries they moving towards smaller families the yellow ones here are the Arabic countries and they get larger families but they no longer life but not larger families the Africans are the green down here they still remain here this is India Indonesia is moving on pretty fast and in the 80s here you have Bangladesh still among the African countries there but now Bangladesh it's a miracle that happens in the 80s the imams start to promote Family Planning and they move up into that corner and in '90s we have the terrible HIV epidemic that takes down the life EXP expectancy of the African countries and all the rest of the world moves up into the corner where we have long lives and small family and we have a completely new world
